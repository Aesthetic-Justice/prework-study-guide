# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

To improve myself and the marketable skills at my disposal, I started this project as the first of many. As such, this project contains several notes as well as a wealth of example code for me to fall-back on for the duration of my education and beyond.
This project made me acquainted with a number of valuable concepts and skills relevant to a career in Web Development, as well as coding/scripting languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript. After having finished this project, I feel much more confident with using VSCode and Git
as a core component in my coding environment. Moving forward, let this project serve as a marking point for a milestone as well as a resource for myself indefinitely.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

As a repository of notes and example code, the index.html file is the best place to start. Within you'll find several quick bullet point notes which will expand into neat little cards when run in a webpage.
the HTML file itself is a good skeleton example for the structure of a webpage and the linked stylesheet(assets/style.css) is a great resource for many different keywords and parameters.
for Javascript, there is assets/script.js. While not containing a large number of more complex containers or native functions, its a great starting point for a beginner WebDev and the results of it can be scene when one inspects the Console when running index.html in a browser.
finally for Git, I've added most of the recurring functions used during the Prework Study Guide to the respective card. Hopefully that'll serve as a back-up in the future.
